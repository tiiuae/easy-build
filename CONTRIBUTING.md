# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* [Submit a ticket for your issue](https://github.com/tiiuae/easy-build/issues), assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone the repo:

````
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/easy-build.git
````


## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

    (#37) Make the example in CONTRIBUTING.md imperative and concrete

    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING.md
    document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
    based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number
    from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
    why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.
````

* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Making Trivial Changes

### Documentation

For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not
always necessary to create a new issue. In this case, it is
appropriate to start the first line of a commit with '(doc)' instead of
a ticket number. 

````
    (doc) Add documentation commit example to CONTRIBUTING.md

    There is no example for contributing a documentation commit
    to the easy-build repository. This is a problem because the contributor
    is left to assume how a commit of this nature may appear.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with '(doc)' in
    place of what would have been the ticket number in a 
    non-documentation related commit. The body describes the nature of
    the new documentation or comments added.
